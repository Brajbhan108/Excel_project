# HR Data Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze data. This process involved several stages, 
including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
## Project Objective 
The primary objective of this project is to analyze employee data to identify key workforce trends, measure organizational performance, and 
provide actionable insights to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and overall productivity.
### Dataset 
- <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ob4JZ7YTZ1AtLM6tUtUdUq-IAnVJ1Shp" > Data Set </a>

### Question 
- Ascertain the total headcount of employees.
- Determine the total count of currently active employees.
- Calculate the number of employees who have exited the organization.
- Evaluate the average work-life balance index among employees.
- Assess the overall employee rating on average.
- Analyze the year-over-year trends in departmental composition and attrition rates.
- Compare the gender distribution across various metrics.
- Identify the marital status distribution within the dataset.
- Examine the travel patterns among employees within the company.
- Investigate the status of overtime work segmented by gender.
### Process
- Join the HR dataset with the Employee Information data sheet.
- Make sure the data is consistent and clean with respective data types, formats, and values used, by using Power Query.
- Create pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all the pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicers to make it dynamic.
- Create a VBA script for clearing all slicers.
### Dashboard
- <a href = "https://github.com/Brajbhan108/Excel_project/blob/main/Dashboard.jpg" > Dashboard </a>
### Observations
- Gender Distribution:
  Workforce consists of 60% males (1,754 employees) and 40% females (1,171 employees).
- Work-Life Balance:
  Average work-life balance rating is 2.76 (out of 4).
  No significant difference in work-life balance between genders.
- Performance Ratings by Marital Status:
  Average performance rating is consistent across all marital statuses (3 out of 4).
- Business Travel:
  Most employees travel rarely (2,075), followed by frequent travel (550) and no travel (300).
  Married employees form the largest group of rare travelers (988).
- Attrition Analysis:
  Overall attrition rate is 16.8% (492 employees left).
  Divorced employees have the highest attrition rate (30.6%).
- Job Involvement:
  Average job involvement is 2.73 (out of 4).
  Divorced and married employees report slightly higher involvement (2.75) compared to single employees (2.69).
- Education Levels:
  Bachelor’s Degree is the most common education level (1,141 employees).
  Females are more represented in Master’s Degrees (306), while males dominate higher education overall.
### Summary 
The workforce has more men than women. Work-life balance and job involvement are average, showing there's room for improvement. 
Divorced employees leave the company the most, which suggests they face challenges. Most employees travel for work rarely, and only a few travel often.
Education data shows employees are generally well-qualified, but men have higher education levels more often. This indicates areas for improvement, 
like better work-life balance policies, ways to keep at-risk groups like divorced employees, and efforts to close the gender and education gaps.
